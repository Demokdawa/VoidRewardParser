# Void Reward Parser
Parses the Void rewards screen for Warframe and displays ducat Values

##To use:

Open in background with Warframe open. As long as Warframe is open it will scan the *primary monitor* for a void rewards screen.
If detected it will parse out any prime parts and display the rarity and Ducat value in a list.

Plays friendliest with borderless window mode and multiple monitors (if using Fullscreen, may steal focus from game requiring you to tab back).


##Requirements:

* **Windows 10**

* .Net Framework 4.5+
