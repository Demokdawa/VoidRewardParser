# Localization


##OCR Settings


##Creating your own Localization:

Copy the "LanguageTemplate.txt", and rename it to match the language you want to add.

On each line, add the translated text to the right side of the comma.

[When saving, make sure to save as Unicode.](http://i.imgur.com/4j6biUC.png)

##Possible Issues

The data is cached, so if you make changes to a Language.txt file after you've created it, you may need to delete the "PrimeData[Language].dat" file in the main directory. This will force the app to recreate the cache for you.
